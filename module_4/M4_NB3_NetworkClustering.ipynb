    "Community detection is an important task in social network analysis. The idea behind it is to identify groups of people that share a common interest, based on the assumption that these people tend to link to each other more than to the rest of the network. Specifically, real-world networks exhibit clustering behavior that can be observed in the graph representation of these networks by the formation of clusters or partitions. These groups of nodes on a graph (clusters) correspond to communities that share common properties, or have a common role in the system under study.\n",

Hence, the selection of $k$ invariably involves a trade-off maximum compression of the data (using a single cluster), and maximum accuracy by assigning each data point to its own cluster.

    "Now, apply spectral graph partitioning to your call graph, and visualize the resulting community structure. You can read more about [Scikit-Learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html), and the [Spectral Clustering](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.SpectralClustering.html) function utilized in this section. Spectral graph partitioning needs input in the form of the number of clusters sought (default setting is 8). There are various approaches one can take to optimize the final number of clusters, depending on problem domain knowledge. Below you will use a value of $k=9$."
