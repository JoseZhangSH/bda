# Module 6: Using data to affect behavior change
Welcome to your practical assessment for Module 6 of MIT Big Data and Social Analytics.



## Objective
This module explores how to affect behavior change through social influence and social incentives, as well as the importance of privacy-protecting practices.

Engage with the mentor team in the forums if you get stuck, or if you learn something that you think is useful.

We hope that you enjoy this course, and acquire skills that are of use to you in your personal journey.

# Notebook 1: Project planning for big data
> **Notebook goal:** Interpret project life cycle management in big data projects, and the challenges in scaling analytical projects, or integrating these within large organizations.

In this notebook, you will be introduced to critical elements in implementing technology initiatives, that is, people and processes. This notebook describes a methodology for managing and planning big data projects,  which will allow you to set up big data projects in your own social or commercial context.

####  List of exercises:
>- **Exercise 1:** List advantages of multimodal approaches.
- **Exercise 2:** Identify various data categories and the information they reveal about individual behavior.
- **Exercise 3:** Identify a social analytics use case based on recent technological innovations.
- **Exercise 4:** List problems that may arise in managing large analytical projects, and suggest corrective actions.

# Notebook 2: Privacy by design: Big data and personal data protection
> **Notebook goal:** Identify the importance, challenges, and approaches to personal data protection in the context of big data.

Advances in technology have resulted in an increase in data collection on individual entities. Unfortunately, this poses a risk to privacy and trust. As a result, many authorities around the globe are introducing regulations for personal data protection. You will be introduced to the concept of data anonymization, and how it is used to mask personal information.

####  List of exercises:
> - **Exercise 1:** Calculate the unicity of a raw data set.
- **Exercise 2:** Calculate and interpret the unicity of a coarsened data set.
- **Exercise 3:** Identify limitations of data anonymization in the context of big data, and suggest alternative data-protection mechanisms.
