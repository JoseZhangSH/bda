    "In Module 4, you evaluated more than 1,400 behavioral indicators for many users in the “Friends and Family” data set. The next logical question to ask is: can you do something useful with these indicators and how can you process or make sense of so many variables or features? The short answer is, without the help of computers, it is virtually impossible. Thanks to machine learning, you can extract answers to meaningful questions using such vast amounts of data. Examples of questions that may be of interest include the following:\n",
    "- What is a person's gender?\n",
    "- How susceptible are they to marketing?\n",
    "- Are there patterns in the data that suggest a higher probability that the person will not be making use of our service?\n",
    "- What is their propensity for taking up a new product or service offering?\n",
    "- Who is best positioned to assist them should they engage with our organization through any one of our channels?\n",

    "### 1.1 What is machine learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "The SAS institute (2016) [defines machine learning](http://www.sas.com/en_us/insights/analytics/machine-learning.html) as “a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. Using algorithms that iteratively learn from data, machine learning allows computers to find hidden insights without being explicitly programmed where to look.” \n",
    "There are two main classes of machine learning algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.1.1 Usupervised learning\n",
    "\n",
    "In *unsupervised learning*, the objective is to identify or infer a function to describe a hidden structure or similarity of patterns in unlabeled data. In Module 4, you were introduced to three different methods that can be used for clustering and community detection in graph networks, namely hierarchical clustering, modularity maximization, and spectral graph partitioning. These methods belong to the unsupervised learning family of machine learning algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.1.2 Supervised learning\n",
    "In *supervised learning*, which is the focus of this notebook, not only are you provided with a set of features ( $ {X}_i$, for $i=1,...,N$) but also a set of labels ${y}_i, i=1,...,N$, where each $y_i$ is a label corresponding to $X_i$. The set of features is also referred to as predictors, and the labels as response, or target variables. For example, you have already been introduced to the very rich set of features one can derive from mobile phone metadata. Basic demographic or socioeconomic information (such as the economic status of an individual, or their gender or age) is typically missing from these data sets. If such information is available for a subset of the population in the database, an interesting challenge, with broad policy implications, is to use mobile phone data to predict these demographic indicators where such information is unavailable or not easily accessible. Read about the use of [mobile phones in global development](https://www.devex.com/news/can-mobile-phone-data-answer-global-development-s-call-88681), for an example of this challenge.\n",
    "Thus, in supervised learning, one uses a given pair of input data and a corresponding supervisory target or desired target, $(y,X)$ to learn a function $f$ that can be used to predict the unknown target value of some input vector, as follows:\n",
    "$$ y = f(X).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, one collects data of known $(y, X)$ pairs that hopefully capture the range of variability and associated outcomes for the domain problem at hand. Learning a function $f$ essentially involves capturing statistical regularities from systems that are potentially very complex and high-dimensional. The learned function $f$ is usually a complicated mathematical expression that describes the data, for example, the behavior of an economically-disadvantaged person from a specific country as observed through their telephone activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional approaches to understanding nature have largely focused on finding a theory or law that describes observed measurements. These laws often take an understandable mathematical form, for example, Newton's laws of motion or Einstein's relativity theory. Understanding nature is then based on reasoning with these laws. Unfortunately, for a large class of problems that are of interest to society (such as those mentioned above), abstracting these problems into a comprehensible mathematical form is a difficult undertaking, as they are often complex, and require measurements of a large number of quantities over a reasonable period of time. Machine learning allows us to discover and make predictions about these systems using large volumes of data. However, for many of these cases, the traditional scientific goal of finding a simple mathematical description becomes elusive as the output of a learning algorithm is a complicated mathematical expression. Therefore, some of these machine learning systems are described or used as “black boxes” – the derived models are not explainable, and people often only care about their predictions.\n",
    "The learning process also uses specified objective functions to optimize when fitting the data. A simple example of an objective function is the sum of squares error formula (used in linear regression) with which you may be familiar. In machine learning, the error term itself is usually referred to as the [loss function](http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/179026/objective-function-cost-function-loss-function-are-they-the-same-thing), and the performance of a given algorithm is commonly reported in terms of the loss function employed. A number of these will be discussed later in the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Model fitting\n",
    "\n",
    "Exactly what does learning entail? At its most basic level, learning involves specifying a model $f$ that can hopefully extract regularities for the data or problem at hand, as well as the appropriate objective function to optimize using a specified loss function. Learning (or fitting) the model essentially means finding optimal parameters of the model structure, using provided input or target data. This is also called training the model. It is common (and best practice) to split the provided data into at least two sets – training and test data sets. The rationale for this split is that you are fitting the model to perform as well as it can using given or seen data. However, your primary goal is for the model to perform well on unseen data. That is, data that you still have to collect, with labels ($y$) that you do not know. To manage this challenge, you will keep part of the collected data hidden from the training or fitting process. Once you are satisfied that you have an optimal model, you can then assess how well the model generalizes on unseen data, using the data that was hidden from the training process. Data used to fit the model is referred to as training data, and data kept hidden from the training – but used to assess the generalization performance of the model – is called test data. There are different variations of this train-and-test split. You may also encounter the term “validation data” being used for essentially the same objective, except for some technicalities that go beyond the scope of this course. The three main reasons why you should evaluate the predictive performance of a model are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Model evaluation:** Estimate the predictive performance of our model on unseen data, which is its generalization performance.\n",
    "- **Model selection:** Assist in tuning the learning algorithm parameters and selecting the best-performing model from a given class.\n",
    "- **Algorithm selection:** Identify the most appropriate learning algorithm for the modeling problem on hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference between model selection and algorithm selection is that selecting an algorithm defines the family of models from within which you can choose an optimal model (model selection). Choosing a different learning algorithm instantiates a different space from within which you will need to select the best-performing model. As a simple example, a linear algorithm implies linear models. You can then pick the best-performing linear model, given the data. Alternatively, choosing a nonlinear algorithm means that you have a more flexible class of models at your disposal. You will need to tune the nonlinear algorithm parameters in order to choose the best-performing model, given the data.\n"

    "### 1.3 Bias-variance trade-off\n",
    "\n",
    "Model and algorithm selection are closely related to the bias-variance trade-off in machine learning and statistics. Bias arises when the statistically-expected model prediction differs from the true value or target (over the training data), and tends to be influenced by model selection. To get an estimate of the expected model prediction, it is common to resample the data and repeat the model-building process. A high prevalence of bias means that these average prediction values are substantially different from the true value. Variance, on the other hand, measures the consistency of the predictions across different training sets, not whether or not they are accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "If your model has low variance and high bias, it will *underfit*, and if it has high variance and low bias it will *overfit*. Selecting a linear model to approximate an underlying nonlinear function introduces a bias, which is due to the linear model’s inability to capture the nonlinearity, resulting in underfitting. On the other hand, selecting a nonlinear model to a estimate an underlying linear function introduces a bias that results in the nonlinear model overfitting. The bias-variance trade-off implies selecting a learning algorithm with low bias, and yet is flexible enough to fit the data well. Too much flexibility in the learning algorithm introduces high variance as the algorithm will always fit each training data set differently. In other words, increasing the bias will decrease the variance, and increasing the variance will decrease the bias. Most of your efforts in the model training process will be around managing this trade-off.\n",
    "\n",
    "The bias-variance trade-off can also be seen through insights from many great philosophers and scientists, in various forms. For example, this can be seen in a quote often attributed to Albert Einstein, which says, \"Everything should be as simple as it can be, but not simpler,” as well as another quote, attributed to William of Ockham, which says, \"More things should not be used than are necessary.\" With respect to application of machine learning in the real world, the following remark by a renowned applied machine learning researcher and practioner is worth noting.\n",

    "The interplay between bias and variance can be visualized using a [bulls-eye diagram](http://scott.fortmann-roe.com/docs/BiasVariance.html). In this representation, the bull's eye at the center of the target is the ground truth, and any deviation from this is an incorrect prediction (model error). Multiple models are built (using different samples from the training data), and the resulting performance of each model is represented by a hit on the board. The scatter in the hits arises from the random variability in the training data (introduced via the resampling). In the plot below are four cases representing different bias and variance combinations that you can expect when fitting models data. Since the truth is not known, various methods such as the learning curve are used to estimate bias in data, and its interplay with variance (Fortmann-Roe 2012).\n",

Mobile phone data has been used to predict the distribution of the wealth of an entire nation or to infer the asset distribution of micro-regions (composed of a few households) based on inferring the socioeconomic status of individual from their past history of mobile phone use (Blumenstock et al. 2015).

The data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant. One class is linearly separable from the other two; the latter two are not linearly separable from each other. Running the cell below gives a 2-dimensional scatterplot of the data using only the sepal features. The class information is overlayed using different colors.\n",

    "> **Note:** Two-dimensional problems are widely used to illustrate fundamental concepts because they easily convey what is happening. In most problems that you will be faced with (such as the “Friends and Family” data that you will be working with in this notebook), the data is high-dimensional and cannot be visualized in the same way as can be done for the iris data, in the demonstration below."

Cross-validation extends this idea further. Instead of having a single train/test split, we can specify so-called folds so that the data is divided into similarly-sized folds. Training occurs by taking all folds except one – referred to as the holdout sample. On the completion of the training, you test the performance of your fitted model using the holdout sample. The holdout sample is then thrown back with the rest of the other folds, and a different fold is pulled out as the new holdout sample. Training is repeated again with the remaining folds and we measure performance using the holdout sample. This process is repeated until each fold has had a chance to be a test or holdout sample. The expected performance of the classifier, called cross-validation error, is then simply an average of error rates computed on each holdout sample. This process is demonstrated by first performing a standard train/test split, and then computing cross-validation error."

For example, in the top left cell, the model condition is \"A\" and the ground truth is also \"A\". The count of instances where these two conditions are true (for a specific data point) is captured, hence the label “True positive”. The same logic applies to the rest of the cells.
