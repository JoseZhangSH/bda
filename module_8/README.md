# Module 8: Data in action
Welcome to your practical assessment for Module 8 of MIT Big Data and Social Analytics.





## Objective
This module will explore how to understand, apply, and gain insights into the use of data in action.

Engage with the tutor team in the forums if you get stuck, or if you learn something that you think is useful.

We hope that you enjoy this course, and acquire skills that are of use to you in your personal journey.

# Notebook 1: Social analytics blueprint
> **Notebook goal:**  Outline how to create a blueprint for social physics experiments.

In this notebook, you will learn how to create a blueprint for your own experiments. The notebook highlights the trade-off between scope, time, and delivery, which leads to the idea of developing a minimum viable product (MVP), and adding features as the project matures.

####  List of exercises:
> - **Exercise 1:** Create a blueprint for a big data and social analytics project.
- **Exercise 2 [Advanced]:** Provide an overview of typical resource requirements, and Phase 0 activities for your selected project.

# Notebook 2: Living labs
> **Notebook goal:** Interpret the use and opportunities provided by the living labs approach.

Living labs describe the paradigm of working with new ideas and technology, and directly engaging with and observing users while they are living their lives. In this notebook, you will learn the advantages of using living labs instead of alternative approaches such as focus groups and large scale surveys.  
####  List of exercises:
> - **Exercise 1:** Provide advantages of living labs and deep data.
- **Exercise 2:** List the roles of the different stakeholders in a living labs set-up.
- **Exercise 3:** Explain the change of the role of a data analyst into a more strategic position in the modern organization.
