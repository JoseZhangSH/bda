    "\n",
    "Many people associate big data with the three Vs model – **volume**, **velocity**, and **variety** – that was introduced by Gartner's [Doug Laney](http://blogs.gartner.com/doug-laney/files/2012/01/ad949-3D-Data-Management-Controlling-Data-Volume-Velocity-and-Variety.pdf). According to this model, the challenges of big data management result from the expansion of all three properties, rather than just the volume of the data alone. The three Vs model is undoubtedly important in describing the technical challenges in the management and processing of big data. However, for analysts, researchers, and decision makers interested in deriving insights from big data, alternative characterizations, building on the three Vs model, may be more appropriate in order to understand and relate to the complexities and value that big data brings. In other words, and from our perspective, a big data approach means collecting as much information as possible, and then assessing its value.\n",

    "## 2.1 The 5 Rs of data quality\n",
    "In the video content in this module, David Shrier discusses the following 5 Rs of data quality:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Relevancy**\n",
    "> This characteristic relates to data fidelity to the research or business objective at hand, and guides how you (as application developers, for example) can design an application that provides enough value to users for them to be willing to give you access to what they consider their most private information.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Recency**\n",
    "> One characteristic of the three Vs model – velocity – affects the time-to-value of data from creation, collection, and usage. Data is constantly changing, and knowing its recency is important for understanding its utility. The question to keep in mind when working with any information is: “How rapidly does that information go out of date?” The latency can come from different phases of analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Range**\n",
    "> Understanding coverage and granularity of data required for answering research or business questions helps in shaping our hypotheses or what conclusions are possible from data collected.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Robustness**\n",
    "> As the volume of the data available for detecting patterns grows exponentially, the number of possible correlations grows a lot faster than the number of meaningful or useful ones. That is, the noise grows faster than the signal, as shown in the figure below.\n",
    "> ![As data gets bigger, noise grows faster than signal.](snr_overtone.png \"As data gets bigger, noise grows faster than signal.\")\n",
    "> Source: [Going Pro in Data Science - What It Takes to Succeed as a Professional Data Scientist by Jerry Overton](http://www.oreilly.com/data/free/going-pro-in-data-science.csp).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reliability**\n",
    ">  An recurring theme in this course is the importance of correctly collecting data. In social analytics, data collecting using well-established techniques, such as using focus or surveys,  are more often not associated with accurate or reliable data. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.2 Ephemeral vs durable data\n",
    "Another related concept in data quality is the need to distinguish between fast- and slow-changing data (i.e., ephemeral and durable data, respectively). Understanding if you have ephemeral data, which changes and decays rapidly, or durable data, which is slow to change, is one of the dimensions of data that is helpful in understanding data quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note**:\n",
    "\n",

   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "As you should have gathered from the previous notebook, Python is an intuitive, beginner-friendly, general-purpose programming language. Unfortunately, because it is a general-purpose language, it lacks out-of-the-box and easy-to-use functionality for data processing and analysis that analysts can use without effort. Because of this, data analysts use Python modules designed specifically to extend Python's base functionality when doing data analysis. One of the modules that will be used extensively in this course is [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) (short for Python for Data Analysis), which is a module designed around providing flexible data structures and data manipulation in Python. Specifically, Pandas uses the concept of a [data frame](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/dsintro.html), which is defined below:\n",
    "\n",
    "> A data frame generally refers to \"tabular\" data, that is, a data structure representing cases (rows), each of which consists of a number of observations or measurements (columns). Each row may be treated as a single observation of multiple variables (or fields in relational database systems). Each row and each column has the same data type, but the row (\"record\") data type may be heterogeneous (a tuple of different types), while the column data type must be homogeneous. In addition to the data, data frames usually contain some metadata, for example, column and row names.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a list of [data frame features](http://wesmckinney.com/blog/a-roadmap-for-rich-scientific-data-structures-in-python/). Data frames allow for the following:\n",
    "- Manipulation of heterogeneously-typed data.\n",
    "- Size mutability. Users can easily add \"columns\" or N-1-dimensional hyperslices without necessarily copying data.\n",
    "- Metadata to be represented by each axis; axis=3 is less meaningful than axis='temperature'.\n",
    "- Metadata to be about axis labels (ticks).\n",
    "- Label or tick-based data alignment or reshaping, which is either automatic or explicit.\n",
    "- Label or tick-based (fancy) indexing, both in terms of setting and getting.\n",
    "- Hierarchical columns.\n",
    "- Robust handling of missing or not-applicable (NA) data.\n",
    "- Operations needing heterogeneous data and metadata. These include group by, filtering, sorting, selection or querying, reindexing (reshaping to conform to a new set of labels), axis selection based on names, data normalization, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data cleaning and exploratory analysis are often the preliminary steps to carry out when confronted with the challenge of extracting useful insights from data. Exploring data prior to doing any deeper analysis allows you to answer questions about data quality. The following sections demonstrate how to use Pandas, and related Python operations, to understand data quality.\n",

You can read from and write to a multitude of data storage structures, including relational databases and non-relational data storage structures such as Hadoop. When you start to approach the boundaries of the available memory and compute capacities of your infrastructure, it is likely time to switch to a data storage system that better supports your needs. However, from an analysis perspective, the most important aspect is being able to interrogate and analyze the data.\n",

While a comma ( , ) is usually used as a delimiter (hence the term CSV, which is the abbreviation for comma-separated values), other common delimiters include a pipe ( | ), a tab ( \\t ), or any single value character (e.g., : ). An enclosing character occurs at the beginning and the end of a value. It is sometimes called a quote character (because it is usually double quotation marks), but other characters can be used.\n",

It is used primarily to transmit data between a server and web application, serving as an alternative to XML (EXtensible Markup Language). Twitter stores data in JSON.

    "Sometimes you are provided with data that needs to be transformed into a form that is more familiar, so that you can do other analyses, or search for patterns or other insights. DataFrames in Pandas are equipped with an \"```apply```\" method that can help with such transformation. These transformations may require the use of other functions. For example, the time field in your GPS data is in a form called Unix time (also known as POSIX time or Epoch time), which is a system for describing instants in time, defined as the number of seconds that have elapsed since 00:00:00 Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), Thursday, 1 January 1970, not counting leap seconds. Unix time is a single signed integer number that increments every second, without requiring the calculations to determine year, month, day of month, hour, and minute, necessary for intelligibility to humans.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Pandas “to_datetime” method will be used to convert the time into something that makes sense to you, by introducing another Python style construct called “**lambda**” functions inside an apply method. Python supports the creation of anonymous, [lambda functions](http://gsl.mit.edu/media/programs/south-africa-summer-2015/materials/diveintopython.pdf) (i.e., functions that are not bound to a name), at runtime, using a construct called \"lambda\".
