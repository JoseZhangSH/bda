    "Python is generally [defined](https://docs.python.org/3/faq/general.html#what-is-python) as a *high-level, general-purpose, interpreted, dynamic computer programming language*. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s try to break this statement down, for those new to computer programming. High-level means that we can express instructions that computers are able to execute in a language that is closer to a human language, and not the machine language that a computer requires to run the instructions. The interpreter is a program that converts the high-level programming instructions into low-level programming instructions that a computer understands. Dynamic means that they do not enforce or check type-safety at “compile-time”, in favor of deferring such checks until “run-time”. This has many advantages, including lower development costs, rapid prototyping, and flexibility required by specific domains, such as data processing and analysis. This makes Python a perfect language for this course, as it is easy to understand (the expressions used are very similar to day-to-day conversations), it has a simple syntax, and provides objects that are appropriate for data processing and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because it’s a programming language, there are some basic computer science concepts that are important to understand before you start coding.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1 Basic concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1.1 Variables\n",
    "Variables are the backbone of any program and, therefore, the backbone of any programming language. A variable is used to store information to be referenced and manipulated in a set of instructions commonly referred to as a computer program. Variables also provide a way of labeling data with a descriptive name, in order for programs to be understood more clearly by the reader and ourselves (recall high-level from above). It is helpful to think of variables as containers that hold information. Their sole purpose is to label and store data in the computer's memory. This data can then be used throughout a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables can store various pieces of information such as the name of a person, that person's age or weight, or their date of birth. Each of these pieces of information contain different types of information. The data type of the variable containing the name of a person would be a string, while the age is stored as an integer, and the date of birth as a datetime object. Fortunately, in Python, unlike in Java or C, you do not need to tell the computer what type a variable is before you assign an object to it. This means that you can begin your program by referring to your name, say, as “X”.\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> X = 'Mary'\n",
    "    \n",
    "In the middle of your program, you might change your mind, and reassign your “X” variable to your age.\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> X = 21\n",
    "\n",
    "This provides you with flexibility that you can exploit to quickly test ideas without worrying that your code will break when executed. As with anything, \"with great flexibility, comes great responsibility!\" It is best practice to use names that are intuitive for the data that the variable stores. The only exception is using names which are reserved by the programming language, called **keywords**. Keywords define the language's rules and structure, and they cannot be used as variable names. Inside Jupyter, a Python reserved name is highlighted differently to other names, as will shortly become clear.\n",
    "\n",
    "A variable’s type also defines what you can do, and the behaviors you can expect, when you perform certain operations on it. This is illustrated later in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1.2 Control structures\n",
    "When we put together a set of instructions for the computer to execute, the computer reads the instructions sequentially. This is known as the \"flow of the code\". However, it is often the case that an instruction in the code requires a decision to be made. For example, say you have written a program to accept interns into your organization. To comply with the labor regulations governing your organization, you ask each candidate to enter their age amongst other details. Before accepting them as an intern, your program checks if the person's age is within the prescribed limits. If not, the application of a potential intern is rejected. Such decision points that affect the flow of the code occur frequently in computer programming and are known as **flow control structures**. [Specifically](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-096-introduction-to-c-january-iap-2011/lecture-notes/MIT6_096IAP11_lec02.pdf):\n",
    "\n",
    "> A control structure is a block of programming that analyzes variables and chooses a direction in which to go based on given parameters. The term flow control details the direction the program takes (which way program control “flows”). Hence it is the basic decision-making process in computing; flow control determines how a computer will respond when given certain conditions and parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Control structures make the programs function properly and, without control structures, your program’s code would only flow linearly from top to bottom. Changing what action a program takes, based on a variable's value, is what makes programming useful. Below, you will be introduced to the different control structures available in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1.3 Data structures\n",
    "A data structure is a particular way of storing and organizing data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently. Previously, you were introduced to the concept of variables using a person's name, age, and date of birth as examples. Imagine doing that for everyone who is enrolled in the MIT Big Data and Social Analytics certificate course. That would be a lot of variables that you would struggle to keep track of. A data structure is a way to get around having to create millions of variables. Python implements many data structures that you will be using, such as lists, dicts, tuples, and sequences. Moreover, other data structures can be built on top of these for efficiently working with data. In Python, the NumPy and Pandas modules provide data structures that are intuitive and expressive enough for many of our needs in data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1.4 Syntax\n",
    "Each programming language is designed and implemented differently, and using it requires adherence to its syntax, which is the set of rules that define the combinations of symbols that are considered to be correctly-structured programs in that language. When these rules are followed, the programming language can understand your instructions and, therefore, you are able to create software that can be run. If you do not adhere to the rules of programming languages’ syntax, you will unfortunately run into errors and your programs will not be executed. As it turns out, the syntax of any programming language tends to be the biggest obstacle many people face when being introduced to programming for the first time, or when learning a new programming language. (Note that syntax errors are only one type of error among many that are possible.) Fortunately, Python will correctly identify syntax errors as it encounters them. This will be useful when trying to find errors in your code. Some key things to remember when using Python are highlighted below.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Case sensitivity**\n",
    "> All variables are case-sensitive. Python treats “number” and “Number” as separate, unrelated entities.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "**Comments**\n",
    "> Commented lines start with the hashtag symbol <font color='#008080'><b> # </b></font> and are ignored when interpreting the code at run-time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Indentation**\n",
    "> Code blocks are demarcated by their indentation. In particular, **control structures** end with a colon <font color='brown'><b> : </b></font> at the decision point. Code blocks indicating action that must be taken when the decision evaluates to \"True\" are demarcated by indentation. \n",
    "\n",
    ">> Note:  **Spaces and tabs do not mix**<br>\n",
    "> Because whitespace is significant, remember that spaces and tabs don't mix, so use only one or the other when indenting your programs. A common error is to conflate them. While they may look the same during editing, the interpreter will read them differently, and it will result in either an error or unexpected behavior. Most decent text editors can be configured to let the tab key emit spaces instead."

    "In summary, this section described what a variable is, how you can store information in it, and then retrieve that information at a later stage. The variable can have a name, and this name is usually informed by the kind of content you’ll be storing in the variable. So, if you’re storing your name in the variable, you would name the variable “yourName”. You would not **have** to give it that name, you could name the variable “WowImProgramming”, but that wouldn’t make much sense considering you are trying to store a person’s name. Finally, variables have types, and these types are used to help us organize what can and cannot be stored in the variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Hint**: Having a type will help to open up what kinds of things we can do with the information inside the variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Example**: If you have two integers (let’s say 50 and 32), you would be able to subtract one variable from the other (i.e., 50 – 32 = 18). But, if you had two variables that stored names (e.g., “Trevor” and “Geoff”) it wouldn’t make sense to subtract one from the other (i.e., “Trevor” – “Geoff”), because that does not mean anything. \n",

    "This is a continuation of your coin flip simulation from the previous section. Although you already have a fairly accurate idea of whether or not the coin is biased, in statistics, the typical approach requires sampling from the underlying distribution multiple times, and then plotting the sampling distribution. To this end, a handle is required on the actual value for the probability of landing heads between 0 and 1 (probability of landing tails will then be 1 minus that value), which can be generated using the \"```random()```\" method from the **random** module, that is the call \"```random.random()```\". In the case of a fair coin, designate as heads anytime the value generated is below 0.5, otherwise it is assigned as tails. An unfair coin can be simulated by adjusting this threshold; the closer the value is to 0 (and below 0.5) the less likely the chance of getting heads in multiple trials. This is an involved complex statistical procedure, and is captured here for illustrative purposes. \n",
